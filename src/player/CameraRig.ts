/**
 * Third-person camera.
 *
 * The camera orbits a pivot at the character's head, offset over the right
 * shoulder, and the crosshair stays dead centre — so the direction the camera
 * looks is still the direction you aim and interact, and all the first-person
 * code (scanning, the interaction probe) keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * Two details do most of the work for feel:
 *  - the boom shortens *instantly* when something gets between camera and
 *    character, and extends back slowly, so you never see through a wall but
 *    the camera does not snap out in doorways;
 *  - the pivot is damped, not the orientation, so looking around stays exact
 *    while the body movement is smoothed.
