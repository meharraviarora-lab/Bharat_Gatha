/**
 * Chapter 11 — the hill forts: Mewar and the Sahyadri.
 *
 * The teaching here is that a fort is an argument about terrain. Rajput
 * giri-durgas and Maratha Sahyadri forts solve the same problem — how does a
 * smaller force survive a larger one — with bent gateways, flanking bastions,
 * rock-cut cisterns and, in Shivaji's case, a navy nobody expected.
