 * Chapter 9 — Vijayanagara (Hampi).

 * Hampi is the best place in the game to teach *historiography*: we know this

 * standing ruins, and the reports of Persian and Portuguese visitors who had
 * their own reasons for exaggerating. Learning to cross-check them is the skill.

    'For two centuries the largest city in the region sprawled across a boulder field on the Tungabhadra: bazaars a kilometre long, aqueducts still irrigating fields today, and a stone chariot that was never meant to move. In 1565 a coalition of Deccan sultanates broke its army at Talikota, and the city was abandoned.',
