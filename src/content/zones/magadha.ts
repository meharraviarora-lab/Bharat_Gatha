 * Chapter 6 — Magadha: the Mauryan empire and, later, Nalanda.

 * This is the zone where India starts speaking to us in its own voice, because
 * Ashoka's edicts are the first substantial Indian texts we can read in the
 * original on the original stone. The Brahmi matching game is therefore the
 * third act of a deliberate three-part lesson: unreadable (Indus), readable
 * (cuneiform), and readable-because-someone-worked-it-out (Brahmi).
